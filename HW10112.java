//    2) Write a program which accepts two given String and checks
//        if they are the rotation of each. If they then return true
//    otherwise return false. A String is said to be a rotation of other
//        string if they contain same characters and the sequence is
//    rotated across any character, e.g. "dabc" is a rotation of "abcd" but "dbac" is not.
